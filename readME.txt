SQLite Database to store tickets and their status

📝 Objective: Create a system that: 
✅ Allows a user to create a ticket by choosing a job type
✅ Generates a unique ticket ID
✅ Allows the administrator to view and update the ticket status
✅ Stores tickets in an SQLite database
✅ Handles errors and exceptions to avoid crashes

Possible improvements:
Add a graphical interface with Tkinter or Flask
Send email notifications when a ticket status changes
Manage users with access levels (Admin/User)
